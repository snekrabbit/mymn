    "In tarot, the suits represent different aspects of life and experiences. There are typically four suits in a standard tarot deck: Cups, Pentacles (also known as Coins or Discs), Swords, and Wands (or Rods). Each suit is associated with specific elements, themes, and areas of life:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Cups: Cups represent emotions, relationships, intuition, and the subconscious mind. They are associated with the element of water, which symbolizes fluidity, intuition, and the depths of the unconscious.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Pentacles: Pentacles represent the material world, including finances, career, health, and physical manifestations of abundance. They are associated with the element of earth, which signifies stability, practicality, and the tangible aspects of life.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Swords: Swords represent the intellect, thoughts, communication, and challenges related to the mind. They often signify conflict, mental clarity, decision-making, and the power of perception.
